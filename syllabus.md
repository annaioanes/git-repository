# Writing in the Disciplines
  
**Anna Ioanes**  
**Tuesday-Thursday, 12:45-2:00**
  
## Overview
This course is about contemporary American literature. We will be trying to determine what each term in that title means. What is contemporary? What is American? What is literature?

We will explore these questions by reading a range of text from 1965 to the present. Projects will include creative and critical assignments that develop your skills in literary analysis, research, and written and oral communication.
